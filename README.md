<h1>Assessing Economic Impact of Flooding in Lodi</h1>

<h2>Permeable Pavement Project Description</h2>
This project evaluates the economic impact of recurrent flooding in Lodi, New Jersey, and assesses the feasibility of using permeable pavement (specifically porous asphalt) as a sustainable flood-mitigation strategy. Drawing on historical flood data, community demographics, and a detailed survey of residents, the study quantifies both the rising frequency and financial costs of flood events and measures local willingness to pay for resiliency solutions. By mapping flood-prone zones, identifying 14 strategic installation sites, and conducting a cost-benefit analysis, the research demonstrates that installing permeable pavement in just 10% of affected areas could reduce long-term flood damages by more than $1.5 billion, far outweighing the estimated $37 million installation cost. Survey findings reveal moderate community support, with most residents willing to contribute up to $100 annually, though many require evidence of proven success before committing. Overall, the project illustrates how targeted green infrastructure investments can significantly strengthen Lodi’s resilience while offering an economically viable pathway to long-term flood reduction.
